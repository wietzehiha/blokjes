# Drupal Project blokjes

## Usage

First you need to [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar) for your setup.

After that you can clone the project.
When the project is cloned, enter the directory and execute:

```
composer install
```

Now you have all dependencies!
Now create the database and edit the database settings in ```./web/sites/default/settings.local.php```.
Then install the website:

```
cd web
./../vendor/bin/drush site-install blokjes --yes
./../vendor/bin/drush config-import --yes
```

Now your site is ready!

You can execute Drupal Console with:

```
./../vendor/bin/console
```

Drupal Console contains many useful tools to generate Drupal 8 elements such as routers and blocks.

With `composer require ...` you can download new dependencies to your installation.

```
composer require drupal/paragraphs:8.*
```

## What does the template do?

When installing the given `composer.json` some tasks are taken care of:

* Drupal will be installed in the `web`-directory.
* Autoloader is implemented to use the generated composer autoloader in `vendor/autoload.php`,
  instead of the one provided by Drupal (`web/vendor/autoload.php`).
* Modules (packages of type `drupal-module`) will be placed in `web/modules/contrib/`
* Theme (packages of type `drupal-theme`) will be placed in `web/themes/contrib/`
* Profiles (packages of type `drupal-profile`) will be placed in `web/profiles/contrib/`
* Creates default writable versions of `settings.php` and `services.yml`.
* Creates `sites/default/files`-directory.
* Latest version of drush is installed locally for use at `vendor/bin/drush`.
* Latest version of DrupalConsole is installed locally for use at `vendor/bin/drupal`.


## Updating Drupal Core

Updating Drupal core is a two-step process.

1. Update the version number of `drupal/core` in `composer.json`.
1. Run `composer update drupal/core`.
1. Run `./scripts/drupal/update-scaffold [drush-version-spec]` to update files
   in the `web` directory, where `drush-version-spec` is an optional identifier
   acceptable to Drush, e.g. `drupal-8.0.x` or `drupal-8.1.x`, corresponding to
   the version you specified in `composer.json`. (Defaults to `drupal-8`, the
   latest stable release.) Review the files for any changes and restore any
   customizations to `.htaccess` or `robots.txt`.
1. Commit everything all together in a single commit, so `web` will remain in
   sync with the `core` when checking out branches or running `git bisect`.

## Generate composer.json from existing project

With using [the "Composer Generate" drush extension](https://www.drupal.org/project/composer_generate)
you can now generate a basic `composer.json` file from an existing project. Note
that the generated `composer.json` might differ from this project's file.


## FAQ

### Should I commit the contrib modules I download

Composer recommends **no**. They provide [argumentation against but also workrounds if a project decides to do it anyway](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md).

### How can I apply patches to downloaded modules?

If you need to apply patches (depending on the project being modified, a pull request is often a better solution), you can do so with the [composer-patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) plugin.

To add a patch to drupal module foobar insert the patches section in the extra section of composer.json:
```json
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/foobar": {
            "Patch description": "URL to patch"
        }
    }
}
```
